At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties . 
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable . 
Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly . 
And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth . 
Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees . 
This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself . 
It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy . 
But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees . 
In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now . 
Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical . 
The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them . 
History and operation of the motor pool . 
While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly . 
Prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned . 
This responsibility included all phases of management . 
It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters . 
In 1942 , however , the nation was at war . 
Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities . 
The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual . 
It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation . 
The motor pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state . 
It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation . 
In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government . 
The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made . 
The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars . 
Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis . 
One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11% . 
`` In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services . 
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles . 
( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) . 
This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive . 
Moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; ; for example , if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years , rather than 44,000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16,000 miles respectively '' . 
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation . 
It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs . 
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work . 
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses . 
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies . 
From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data . 
In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile . 
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles . 
They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year . 
Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random . 
One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities . 
Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment . 
Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more . 
Purchasing practices . 
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state . 
Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made . 
Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders . 
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public . 
The reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay . 
Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers . 
In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier . 
This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles . 
The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later . 
Vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles . 
The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles . 
The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration . 
The Rhode Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well . 
For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax . 
This tax was discontinued in 1936 . 
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years . 
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well . 
Thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments . 
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements . 
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level . 
Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax . 
This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored . 
Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property . 
Problems of taxing personal property . 
Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value . 
These problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states . 
Situs of property . 
Although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the situs of property , i.e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment . 
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated . 
It also provides for the taxation of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state . 
In defining personal property , it specifically mentions `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad '' . 
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year . 
Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated . 
This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31 . 
Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles . 
The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged . 
Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December . 
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft . 
A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield . 
This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably . 
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year '' . 
The Smithfield tax assessor , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated '' . 
Assessment of value . 
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem . 
This accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island . 
This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted . 
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : `` The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property . 
An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State . 
A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' . 
The Institute of Public Administration , in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 , recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job '' . 
The resulting setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island '' . 
Practices in Rhode Island . 
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island . 
The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case .
